## Overview

Teams can request subscriptions for **General Use** from CloudOps team with up to Owner permissions, thus democratizing access to deploy, configure, and manage their applications with limited involvement from CloudOps team.  CloudOps team can choose to limit the permission using custom roles as deemed appropriate based on risk and requirements.

Examples of generalized use includes:

* Prototypes & Proof of Concepts
* Lift & Modernize
* Specialized architectures including commercial/ISV software deployments

Azure Policies are used to provide governance, compliance and protection while enabling teams to use their preferred toolset to use Azure services.

![Archetype:  Generic Subscription](../media/architecture/archetype-generic-subscription.jpg)

**CloudOps team will be required for**

1. Establishing connectivity to Hub virtual network (required for egress traffic flow & Azure Bastion).
2. Creating App Registrations (required for service principal accounts).  This is optional based on whether App Registrations are disabled for all users or not.

**Workflow**

* A new subscription is created through existing process (either via ea.azure.com or Azure Portal).
* The subscription will automatically be assigned to the **pubsecSandbox** management group.
* CloudOps will create a Service Principal Account (via App Registration) that will be used for future DevOps automation.
* CloudOps will scaffold the subscription with baseline configuration.
* CloudOps will hand over the subscription to requesting team.

**Subscription Move**

Subscription can be moved to a target Management Group through Azure ARM Templates/Bicep.  Move has been incorporated into the landing zone Azure DevOps Pipeline automation.

**Capabilities**

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Service Health Alerts | Configures Service Health alerts such as Security, Incident, Maintenance.  Alerts are configured with email, sms and voice notifications. |
| Microsoft Defender for Cloud | Configures security contact information (email and phone). |
| Subscription Role Assignments | Configures subscription scoped role assignments.  Roles can be built-in or custom. |
| Subscription Budget | Configures monthly subscription budget with email notification. Budget is configured by default for 10 years and the amount. |
| Subscription Tags | A set of tags that are assigned to the subscription. |
| Resource Tags | A set of tags that are assigned to the resource group and resources.  These tags must include all required tags as defined the Tag Governance policy. |
| Automation | Deploys an Azure Automation Account in each subscription. |
| Hub Networking | Configures virtual network peering to Hub Network which is required for egress traffic flow and hub-managed DNS resolution (on-premises or other spokes, private endpoints).
| Networking | A spoke virtual network with minimum 4 zones: oz (Operational Zone), paz (Public Access Zone), rz (Restricted Zone), hrz (Highly Restricted Zone).  Additional subnets can be configured at deployment time using configuration (see below). |

### Deployment Instructions

> Use the [Onboarding Guide for Azure DevOps](../onboarding/ado.md) to configure the `subscription` pipeline.  This pipeline will deploy workload archetypes such as Generic Subscription.

Parameter files for archetype deployment are configured in [config/subscription folder](../../config/subscriptions).  The directory hierarchy is comprised of the following elements, from this directory downward:

1. A environment directory named for the Azure DevOps Org and Git Repo branch name, e.g. 'CanadaESLZ-main'.
2. The management group hierarchy defined for your environment, e.g. pubsec/Platform/LandingZone/Prod. The location of the config file represents which Management Group the subscription is a member of.

For example, if your Azure DevOps organization name is 'CanadaESLZ', you have two Git Repo branches named 'main' and 'dev', and you have top level management group named 'pubsec' with the standard structure, then your path structure would look like this:

```
/config/subscriptions
    /CanadaESLZ-main           <- Your environment, e.g. CanadaESLZ-main, CanadaESLZ-dev, etc.
        /pubsec                <- Your top level management root group name
            /LandingZones
                /Prod
                    /xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_generic-subscription.json
```

The JSON config file name is in one of the following two formats:

- [AzureSubscriptionGUID]\_[TemplateName].json
- [AzureSubscriptionGUID]\_[TemplateName]\_[DeploymentLocation].json

The subscription GUID is needed by the pipeline; since it's not available in the file contents, it is specified in the config file name.

The template name/type is a text fragment corresponding to a path name (or part of a path name) under the '/landingzones' top level path. It indicates which Bicep templates to run on the subscription. For example, the generic subscription path is `/landingzones/lz-generic-subscription`, so we remove the `lz-` prefix and use `generic-subscription` to specify this type of landing zone.

The deployment location is the short name of an Azure deployment location, which may be used to override the `deploymentRegion` YAML variable. The allowable values for this value can be determined by looking at the `Name` column output of the command: `az account list-locations -o table`.
