## Overview

Teams can request subscriptions from CloudOps team with up to Owner permissions for **Data & AI workloads**, thus democratizing access to deploy, configure, and manage their applications with limited involvement from CloudOps team.  CloudOps team can choose to limit the permission using custom roles as deemed appropriate based on risk and requirements.

Azure Policies are used to provide governance, compliance and protection while enabling teams to use their preferred toolset to use Azure services.

![Archetype:  Machine Learning](../media/architecture/archetype-machinelearning.jpg)

**CloudOps team will be required for**

1. Establishing connectivity to Hub virtual network (required for egress traffic flow & Azure Bastion).
2. Creating App Registrations (required for service principal accounts).  This is optional based on whether App Registrations are disabled for all users or not.

**Workflow**

*	A new subscription is created through existing process (either via ea.azure.com or Azure Portal).
*	The subscription will automatically be assigned to the **pubsecSandbox** management group.
* CloudOps will create a Service Principal Account (via App Registration) that will be used for future DevOps automation.
* CloudOps will scaffold the subscription with baseline configuration.
* CloudOps will hand over the subscription to requesting team.

**Subscription Move**

Subscription can be moved to a target Management Group through Azure ARM Templates/Bicep.  Move has been incorporated into the landing zone Azure DevOps Pipeline automation.

1. Data can be ingested from various sources using Data Factory, which uses managed virtual network for its Azure hosted integration runtime.
2. The data would be stored in Azure Data Lake Gen 2.
3. Structured data can be stored in SQL Database, or SQL Managed Instance.
4. Data engineering and transformation tasks can be done with Spark using Azure Databricks. Transformed data would be stored back in the data lake.
5. Machine learning would be done using Azure Machine Learning.
6. Models would be containerized and pushed to Azure Container Registry from Azure ML.
7. Models would be the deployed as services to Azure Kubernetes Service from Container Registry.
8. Secrets and keys would be stored safely in Azure Key Vault.
9. Monitoring and logging would be through Application Insights.

## Access Control

Once the machine learning archetype is deployed and available to use, access control best practices should be applied. Below is the recommend set of security groups & their respective Azure role assignments.  This is not an inclusive list and could be updated as required.

**Replace `PROJECT_NAME` placeholder in the security group names with the appropriate project name for the workload**.

| Security Group | Azure Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SG_PROJECT_NAME_ADMIN | Subscription with `Owner` role. | Admin group for subscription. |
| SG_PROJECT_NAME_READ | Subscription with `Reader` role. | Reader group for subscription. |
| SG_PROJECT_NAME_DATA_PROVIDER | Data Lake (main storage account) service with `Storage Blob Data Contributor` role.  Key Vault service with `Key Vault Secrets User`. | Data group with access to data as well as key vault secrets usage.
| SG_PROJECT_NAME_DATA_SCIENCE | Azure ML service with `Contributor` role.  Azure Databricks service with `Contributor` role.  Key Vault service with `Key Vault Secrets User`. | Data science group with compute access as well as key vault secrets usage. |

## Networking and Security Configuration

![Networking](../media/architecture/archetype-machinelearning-networking.jpg)

| Service Name | Settings | Private Endpoints / DNS | Subnet(s)|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Key Vault | Network ACL Deny | Private endpoint on `vault` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| SQL Mananged Instance | N/A | N/A | `sqlmi`|
| SQL Database | Deny public network access | Private endpoint on `sqlserver` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| Azure Data Lake Gen 2 | Network ACL deny | Private endpoint on `blob`, `dfs` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| Azure Databricks | No public IP enabled (secure cluster connectivity), load balancer for egress with IP and outbound rules, virtual network ibjection | N/A |  `databricksPrivate`, `databricksPublic`|
| Azure Machine Learning | No public workspace access | Private endpoint on `amlWorkspace` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| Azure Storage Account for Azure ML | Network ACL deny | Private endpoint on `blob`, `file` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| Azure Data Factory | Public network access disabled, Azure integration runtime with managed virtual network | Private endpoint on `dataFactory` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| Azure Kubernetes Service | Private cluster, network profile with kubenet | N/A | `aks`|
| Azure Container Registry | Network ACL deny, public network access disabled | Private endpoint on `registry` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| Azure Application Insights | N/A | N/A | N/A |

This archetype also has the following security features as options for deployment:

* Customer managed keys for encryption at rest, including Azure ML, storage, Container Registry, Data Factory, SQL Database / Managed Instance, and Kubernetes Service.

* Azure ML has ability to enable high-business impact workspace which controls amount of data Microsoft collects for diagnostic purposes.

## Customer Managed Keys

To enable customer-managed key scenarios, some services including Azure Storage Account and Azure Container Registry require deployment scripts to run with a user-assigned identity to enable encryption key on the respective instances.

Therefore, when the `useCMK` parameter is `true`, a deployment identity is created and assigned `Owner` role to the compute and storage resource groups to run the deployment scripts as needed. Once the services are provisioned with customer-managed keys, the role assignments are automatically deleted.

The artifacts created by the deployment script such as Azure Container Instance and Storage accounts will be automatically deleted 1 hour after completion.

## Secrets

Temporary passwords are autogenerated, and connection strings are automatically stored as secrets in Key Vault. They include:

* SQL Database username, password, and connection string In the case of choosing SQL Authentication, if choosing Azure AD authentication, no secrets needed.
* SQL Managed Instance username, password, and connection string

## Logging

Azure Policy will enable diagnostic settings for all PaaS components in the machine learning archetype and the logs will be sent to the centralized log analytics workspace.  These policies are configured at the management group scope and are not explicitly deployed.

## Testing

Test scripts are provided to verify end to end integration. These tests are not automated so minor modifications are needed to set up and run.

The test scripts are located in [tests/landingzones/lz-machinelearning/e2e-flow-tests](../../tests/landingzones/lz-machinelearning/e2e-flow-tests)

The scripts are:

1. Azure ML SQL connection and Key Vault integration test
2. Azure ML terminal connection to ACR test
3. Databricks integration with Key Vault, SQL MI, SQL Database, Data Lake test
4. Azure ML deployment through ACR to AKS test

> Use the [Onboarding Guide for Azure DevOps](../onboarding/ado.md) to configure the `subscription` pipeline.  This pipeline will deploy workload archetypes such as Machine Learning.

Parameter files for archetype deployment are configured in [config/subscription folder](../../config/subscriptions).  The directory hierarchy is comprised of the following elements, from this directory downward:

1. A environment directory named for the Azure DevOps Org and Git Repo branch name, e.g. 'CanadaESLZ-main'.
2. The management group hierarchy defined for your environment, e.g. pubsec/Platform/LandingZone/Prod. The location of the config file represents which Management Group the subscription is a member of.

For example, if your Azure DevOps organization name is 'CanadaESLZ', you have two Git Repo branches named 'main' and 'dev', and you have top level management group named 'pubsec' with the standard structure, then your path structure would look like this:

```
/config/subscriptions
    /CanadaESLZ-main           <- Your environment, e.g. CanadaESLZ-main, CanadaESLZ-dev, etc.
        /pubsec                <- Your top level management root group name
            /LandingZones
                /Prod
                    /xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx_machinelearning.json
```

The JSON config file name is in one of the following two formats:

- [AzureSubscriptionGUID]\_[TemplateName].json
- [AzureSubscriptionGUID]\_[TemplateName]\_[DeploymentLocation].json

The subscription GUID is needed by the pipeline; since it's not available in the file contents, it is specified in the config file name.

The template name/type is a text fragment corresponding to a path name (or part of a path name) under the '/landingzones' top level path. It indicates which Bicep templates to run on the subscription. For example, the machine learning path is `/landingzones/lz-machinelearning`, so we remove the `lz-` prefix and use `machinelearning` to specify this type of landing zone.

The deployment location is the short name of an Azure deployment location, which may be used to override the `deploymentRegion` YAML variable. The allowable values for this value can be determined by looking at the `Name` column output of the command: `az account list-locations -o table`.
