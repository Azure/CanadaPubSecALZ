## Overview

Teams can request subscriptions from CloudOps team with up to Owner permissions for **Healthcare workloads**, thus democratizing access to deploy, configure, and manage their applications with limited involvement from CloudOps team.  CloudOps team can choose to limit the permission using custom roles as deemed appropriate based on risk and requirements.

Azure Policies are used to provide governance, compliance and protection while enabling teams to use their preferred toolset to use Azure services.

![Archetype:  Healthcare](../media/architecture/archetype-healthcare.jpg)

**CloudOps team will be required for**

1.  Establishing connectivity to Hub virtual network (required for egress traffic flow & Azure Bastion).
2.  Creating App Registrations (required for service principal accounts).  This is optional based on whether App Registrations are disabled for all users or not.

**Workflow**

*  A new subscription is created through existing process (either via ea.azure.com or Azure Portal).
*  The subscription will automatically be assigned to the **pubsecSandbox** management group.
* CloudOps will create a Service Principal Account (via App Registration) that will be used for future DevOps automation.
* CloudOps will scaffold the subscription with baseline configuration.
* CloudOps will hand over the subscription to requesting team.

**Subscription Move**

Subscription can be moved to a target Management Group through Azure ARM Templates/Bicep.  Move has been incorporated into the landing zone Azure DevOps Pipeline automation.

## Access Control

Once the machine learning archetype is deployed and available to use, access control best practices should be applied. Below is the recommend set of security groups & their respective Azure role assignments.  This is not an inclusive list and could be updated as required.

**Replace `PROJECT_NAME` placeholder in the security group names with the appropriate project name for the workload**.

| Security Group | Azure Role | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SG_PROJECT_NAME_ADMIN | Subscription with `Owner` role. | Admin group for subscription. |
| SG_PROJECT_NAME_READ | Subscription with `Reader` role. | Reader group for subscription. |

## Networking and Security Configuration

![Networking](../media/architecture/archetype-healthcare-networking.jpg)

| Service Name | Settings | Private Endpoints / DNS | Subnet(s)|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Key Vault | Network ACL Deny | Private endpoint on `vault` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| SQL Database | Deny public network access | Private endpoint on `sqlserver` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| Azure Data Lake Gen 2 | Network ACL deny | Private endpoint on `blob`, `dfs` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| Synapse | Disabled public network access; managed virtual network; Data exfiltration protection enabled | *  Managed Private Endpoints & Synapse Studio Private Link Hub. Private endpoint DNS registration. | `privateEndpoints` |
| Azure Databricks | No public IP enabled (secure cluster connectivity), load balancer for egress with IP and outbound rules, virtual network ibjection | N/A |  `databricksPrivate`, `databricksPublic`|
| Azure Machine Learning | No public workspace access | Private endpoint on `amlWorkspace` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|
| Azure Storage Account for Azure ML | Network ACL deny | Private endpoint on `blob`, `file` + DNS registration to either hub or spoke | `privateEndpoints`|

This archetype also has the following security features as options for deployment:

* Customer managed keys for encryption at rest, including Azure ML, storage, Container Registry, Data Factory, SQL Database, Azure Machine Learning, Synapse Analytics and Kubernetes Service.

* Azure ML has ability to enable high-business impact workspace which controls amount of data Microsoft collects for diagnostic purposes.

## Customer Managed Keys

To enable customer-managed key scenarios, some services including Azure Storage Account and Azure Container Registry require deployment scripts to run with a user-assigned identity to enable encryption key on the respective instances.

Therefore, when the `useCMK` parameter is `true`, a deployment identity is created and assigned `Owner` role to the compute and storage resource groups to run the deployment scripts as needed. Once the services are provisioned with customer-managed keys, the role assignments are automatically deleted.

If customer-managed key is required for the FHIR API, a separate Key Vault with access policy permission model is required.

The artifacts created by the deployment script such as Azure Container Instance and Storage accounts will be automatically deleted 1 hour after completion.

## Secrets
Temporary passwords are autogenerated, and connection strings are automatically stored as secrets in Key Vault. They include:

* SQL Database username, password, and connection string In the case of choosing SQL Authentication, if choosing Azure AD authentication, no secrets needed.
* Synapse username and password

## Logging

Azure Policy will enable diagnostic settings for all PaaS components in the machine learning archetype and the logs will be sent to the centralized log analytics workspace.  These policies are configured at the management group scope and are not explicitly deployed.

## Testing

Test scripts are provided to verify end to end integration. These tests are not automated so minor modifications are needed to set up and run.

The test scripts are located in [tests/landingzones/lz-healthcare/e2e-flow-tests](../../tests/landingzones/lz-healthcare/e2e-flow-tests)

The scripts are:

1. Azure ML Key Vault integration test
2. Azure ML terminal connection to ACR test
3. Databricks integration with Key Vault Data Lake test
4. Synapse integration tests for SQL Serverless, Spark, and SQL DW (dedicated) Pools

**Considerations for testing Azure Data Factory and Synapse using managed virtual networks**

* Data Factory - in order to test connectivity to data lake, ensure a managed private endpoint is set up along with interactive authoring enabled
* Synapse Analytics
  * Pipeline, ensure a managed private endpoint is set up along with interactive authoring enabled to test connectivity to data lake
  * SQL Serverless connectivity to data lake:
    * The default connectivity is to use user identity passthrough, thus, the user should have storage blob data contributor role to the role
    * Managed Synapse identity can be used, which the landing zone deployment automatically grants the MSI storage blob data contributor to the data lake
    * Upload some data to the default ADLS Gen 2 of Synapse
    * Run the integration tests for Synapse SQL Serverless Pool
  * Spark pool connectivity to data lake
    *  Ensure the user has storage blob data contributor role for the data lake
    *  Upload some data to the default ADLS Gen 2 of Synapse
    *  Run the integration tests for Synapse Spark Pool
  * Dedicated SQL (SQL Data warehouse)
    *  Ensure the user identity has a SQL Login (e.g. the admin user could be assigned the SQL AD admin)
    *  Upload some data to the default ADLS Gen 2 of Synapse
    *  Run the integration tests for Synapse SQL Dedicated Pool (DW)

### Delete Locks

As an administrator, you can lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. The lock overrides any permissions the user might have.  You can set the lock level to `CanNotDelete` or `ReadOnly`.  Please see [Azure Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources) for more information.

**This archetype does not use `CanNotDelete` nor `ReadOnly` locks as part of the deployment.  You may customize the deployment templates when it's required for your environment.**
