## Schema Definition

Reference implementation uses parameter files with `object` parameters to consolidate parameters based on their context.  The schemas types are:

* Schema (version: `latest`)

  * Common
    * [Service Health Alerts](../../schemas/latest/landingzones/types/serviceHealthAlerts.json)
    * [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](../../schemas/latest/landingzones/types/securityCenter.json)
    * [Subscription Role Assignments](../../schemas/latest/landingzones/types/subscriptionRoleAssignments.json)
    * [Subscription Budget](../../schemas/latest/landingzones/types/subscriptionBudget.json)
    * [Subscription Tags](../../schemas/latest/landingzones/types/subscriptionTags.json)
    * [Resource Tags](../../schemas/latest/landingzones/types/resourceTags.json)

## Delete Locks

As an administrator, you can lock a subscription, resource group, or resource to prevent other users in your organization from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. The lock overrides any permissions the user might have.  You can set the lock level to `CanNotDelete` or `ReadOnly`.  Please see [Azure Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/lock-resources) for more information.

By default, this archetype deploys `CanNotDelete` lock to prevent accidental deletion on all resource groups it creates.
