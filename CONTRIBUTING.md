# Contributing Reference Implementation

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit
https://cla.microsoft.com.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need
to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the
instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.

## Getting Started

* You are free to work on automation templates on any platform using any editor, but you may find it quickest to get started using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) with the [Bicep extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep).

* Fork this repository

* Clone the forked repository to your local development environment


## Deployment to your environment

See [Onboarding Guide for Azure DevOps](ONBOARDING_GUIDE_ADO.md)

## Pull Requests

* Ensure that a user story or an issue has been created to track the feature enhancement or bug that is being fixed.

* In the PR description, make sure you've included "Fixes #{issue_number}" e.g. "Fixes #242" so that Azure DevOps or GitHub knows to link it to an issue.

* To avoid multiple contributors working on the same issue, please add a comment to the issue to let us know you plan to work on it.

* If a significant amount of design is required, please include a proposal in the issue and wait for approval before working on code. If there's anything you're not sure about, please feel free to discuss this in the issue. We'd much rather all be on the same page at the start, so that there's less chance that drastic changes will be needed when your pull request is reviewed.

## Feature Suggestions

* Ensure you have included a "What?" - what your feature entails, being as specific as possible, and giving use cases where possible.

* Ensure you have included a "Why?" - what the benefit of including this feature will be.

## Bug Reports

* Be as specific as possible such as steps to reproduce the issue, and any example files or snippets of code needed to reproduce it.
